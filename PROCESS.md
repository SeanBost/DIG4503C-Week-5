Week 5 Exercise - Browser-Based AI Development

**********

1. What did you build? 

A simple nametag creator! A user is presented with a form with first name, last name, job title, and hometown fields. Upon entering something into each field and clicking submit a nametag is created. This nametag displays the provided info in the form in a stylized way. If a new nametag is desired, new information can be input into the form and a resubmission will update the nametag.

2. How did micro-iteration feel?

Empowering. Despite using AI professionally for copy extensively, I dislike relying on it. Micro-iterations with code creation mirror what I do for content, and I feel this approach strikes a good balance between maintaining control/creative direction and saving a lot of time writing everything yourself.

3. What did self-review catch?

Lots! Logic code made redundant, missing input validation, issues with mobile and accessible usage, minor occasions where the AI and my own visions weren't clarified and aligned. 

4. Tool impressions (Claude Code Web)

I'm fond of Claude Code for Web. I get to avoid vscode and the GitHub integration was extremely intuitive. This would be my preferred way to code with AI support in general.

5. Self-review patterns

The AI was pretty adept at catching some best practice fails regarding redundant code and accessibility choices in styling, but I also had to personally ask it about mobile friendliness. I feel self-review is very necessary if not for every single step, along with human eyes to catch common-sense things AI might miss.

6. Browser tool vs. CLI comparison

CLI might be more streamlined, but I strongly prefer using a browser tool and appreciate the degree of separation.

7. When would you use micro-iteration + self-review?

Anytime I build something with AI going forward. Boilerplates maybe not, but when I want to add meaningfully complex features or adjustments I see no harm and only benefit in using both micro-iterations and self-review.
